# RestaurantLoginPage
The RestaurantLoginPage is a modern, secure, and user-friendly login interface designed specifically for restaurant management systems. This project utilizes HTML for the structural framework, CSS for responsive and aesthetic styling, JavaScript for dynamic interactivity, ReactJS for building reusable components and managing state efficiently, and Node.js for robust server-side logic. On the frontend, ReactJS is employed to create a seamless user experience with dynamic form validation and immediate feedback on input errors.
